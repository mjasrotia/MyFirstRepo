# Mission Accomplished

**You did it! Your final Schema is ready and so are you!**

## **What we did**

* We identified our lookup schemas used in conjunction with the Customer Account Schema.
* We created the Relationship descriptor to define relationship between Customer Account and the lookup schemas.
* We created Reference Identity descriptors on the foreign key(s) in the Customer Account Schema.
* We browsed the schema both through UI and API calls and confirmed our relationships.
