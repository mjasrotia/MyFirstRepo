**This collection has the following folders: AEP Bootcamp API Lab collection**

* **IMS Authenticate**
  * Contains all the API call to authenticate the client credentials to execute API calls.
* **XDM API Lab**
  * Contains all the API calls to create XDM components like Schema, Field Groups, Primary/non-primary and Relationship Identities.
* **Reference API Calls**
  * Contains some reference **“GET”** API calls to help you navigate the Schema registry
  * You can use these API calls to browse the XDM components you created and also to get identifiers of various XDM components which you would need as you go through the API Lab. It would be good to have at least have a glance at these
  * Please note that you will have to **create/POST** the XDM components first to expect results in the GET API calls.
  * Below is a sample screen shot of the folders in your **POSTMAN** collection.
* **Pipeline API Lab**
  * Contains streaming API calls to send Customer and Orders sample payloads
* **Profile API Lab**
  * Contains API calls to lookup profile, experience events and identity graphs.
