## **AEP Foundations Bootcamp Collection Overview**

The API collection you imported contains all the necessary API calls you will need for labs throughout the bootcamp.  Each lab is organized into a specific folder with its own set of APIs.  Please be aware of this as you work through labs this week.

Details about each folder can be found below:

* **IMS Authenticate** - contains a single request to generate an access\_token which is required when working with any of the Adobe Experience Platform APIs
* **XDM Schema Lab** - contains a set of requests for creating the XDM components necessary for building and configuring a schema for the Real-Time Customer Profile
* **Data Ingestion Lab** - contains a set of requests for streaming data into the Experience Platform
* **Profile Lab** - contains a set of requests for viewing the Real-Time Customer Profile's traits and behaviors
