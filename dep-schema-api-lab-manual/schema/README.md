# Schema

**Great! Our Postman is all set up and we are just getting started.**

## **Learning Objectives**

Identify the standard XDM field groups to be included in the “Customer Account” Schema . Create a custom schema to add additional properties which are not included in the standard field groups. Create the “Customer Account” Schema. Browse the created schema through API calls and UI. Assuming, we missed to add a property to our schema, we will use JSON Patch to add a custom property.

## **What you should expect to see in the schema**

* After performing the steps in the next section, your schema should look like below.
